This is a simple todo app built with React and styled with Sass. The app allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks or to-do items. The user can mark a task as complete or incomplete, and the app also includes a filter function to sort the tasks by status or priority.


## <a id="features">Features</a>
- Add items to the list: When adding items to the list, you have the option to mark them as complete.
- Complete and incomplete items: Each item on the list has a check button that can be used to mark the item as complete or incomplete. 
- When an item is marked as complete, the check button is filled with a check icon and the text of the item is crossed out.
- Drag and drop to reorder: You can drag and drop items on the list to change their order.
- Filter by completion status: At the bottom of the list, there is a menu that displays the number of pending items and has options to show all items, completed items, or incomplete items.
- Clear completed items: The menu also has an option to clear completed items from the list.
